libCellML Documentation
=======================

This is the libCellML documentation for libCellML version |version|.

The :doc:`Roadmap <roadmap>` contains a rough guideline on the direction that the development of the library is intending on following.  For people wishing to contribute to the libCellML project read the :doc:`Developer's Documentation <developer/index>` to become familiar with the development process.  The :doc:`Object Model <objectmodel/index>` describes, at a high level, how the libCellML library will implement the CellML 1.2 specification.
